%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the BAC team at BMW for their invaluable support throughout my work. A very special thanks goes to my BMW supervisor, Johannes Urlhardt, for his tremendous guidance, support, and the generous time he dedicated to assist me. I am also deeply grateful to my university supervisor, Jianfeng Gu, for his understanding, advice, and continuous support during this project. Additionally, I would like to thank the company Vector for providing us with a license to use their software.
